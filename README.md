#### Universal Turing Simulator ####

The program prompts the user to input turing readable instructions. The code for an arbitrary Turing machine is a set of quadruples. The user inputs each entry for each quadruple when prompted. Itâs recommended that the user prepare the Turing code before interacting with the program (unless the user is comfortable programming Turing machines on the fly).   

### How to ###

Run the program from the command line and test out your Turing code on arbitrary pairs of natural numbers.
